            desc: "Phishing is a fraudulent attempt to obtain sensitive data such as usernames and passwords through fake emails and websites. Attackers use social engineering to create a sense of urgency, often mimicking banks or government agencies to trick users into clicking malicious links.",
            impact: "Primary cause of credential theft and initial access for larger network breaches. Prevention involves email filtering and user awareness training."
        },
        "malware": {
            title: "Malware & Malicious Code",
            desc: "Malware includes viruses, worms, and trojans designed to damage or gain unauthorized access to systems. These programs can self-replicate across networks or hide within legitimate software to spy on user activity.",

            title: "Ransomware Operations",
            desc: "Ransomware encrypts user data and demands payment for restoration. Modern ransomware often involves 'double extortion,' where data is both encrypted and stolen to be leaked publicly if the ransom isn't paid.",
            impact: "Massive operational downtime and financial loss. Recovery is often impossible without verified offline backups."

            title: "SQL Injection (SQLi)",
            desc: "A vulnerability where an attacker interferes with the queries that an application makes to its database. It allows attackers to view data they are not normally able to retrieve.",
            impact: "Complete database exposure, including user passwords and personal records. Prevented by using prepared statements and input validation."

            title: "Two-Factor Authentication (2FA)",

            desc: "Regular software updates fix vulnerabilities and security flaws discovered by developers. Many attacks exploit 'known' bugs that already have patches available.",
